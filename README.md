# AfriCuisine

## Executive Summary
The purpose of this project is to provide customers with fast and secure methods for placing food orders online. Through the web application, the restaurant will be able to take more orders, promote their business, and it will help AfriCuisine's owner to manage requests.
The web application will allow the restaurant to increase their product offering in the community, while at the same time, allowing customers to use social media accounts to login quickly. Africuisine will be able to provide a secure online payment option as well. Customers will also be notified via texts or emails when their orders are ready.
